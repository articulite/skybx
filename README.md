**SKYBX** is an open-source project that brings the power of [Blockade Labs](https://www.blockadelabs.com/)' AI-powered skybox generation tool into an immersive WebXR environment. This project enables users to create stunning skyboxes in a 3D world and experience the generated environments as if they were truly inhabiting them.

SKYBX is developed using the [Elixr engine](https://elixrjs.io/), a WebXR-centric framework built on top of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) which integrates a robust Entity Component System (ECS) and the high-performance [Rapier](https://rapier.rs/) physics engine.

## Features

- ü§ñ Tight integration with Blockade Labs' AI-powered skybox generation tool
- üåê Immersive experience when creating skyboxes in a 3D environment
- üåü Cross-platform compatibility for a wide range of WebXR-supported devices
- üé® Friendly and easy-to-use user interface for seamless skybox generation
